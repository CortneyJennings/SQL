Cortney's Data Portfolio
Welcome to My Data Portfolio

Hi, I’m Cortney Jennings — a data professional with experience turning raw data into actionable insights. This repository is a collection of my work across:

SQL — queries, analysis, and database projects

Excel — advanced functions, automation, and dynamic dashboards

Power BI & Tableau — interactive dashboards and data visualizations

What You’ll Find Here

Real examples of SQL scripts I’ve written for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data

Excel projects showcasing formulas, pivot tables, and professional dashboards

Interactive dashboards built in Power BI and Tableau, highlighting trends, KPIs, and business insights

Why This Portfolio?

I enjoy solving problems with data — from uncovering patterns to telling stories through visualization. My projects demonstrate not only technical skills but also my ability to communicate insights clearly and effectively.
